# Composer CircleCI Orb

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/stockfiller/php-cs-fixer-orb.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/stockfiller/composer-orb)

A [CircleCI orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/) for running [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) tasks, such as installing
dependencies.

Doing a `composer install` inside of a CI environment often comes with more responsibilities, such as handling
dependency caching. The purpose of this orb is to provide a quick way of doing a `composer install`, while handling the
boilerplate caching for you.
